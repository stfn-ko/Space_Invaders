# Space Invaders Game
Trying to rework my childhood favorite game with SFML and some C++ magic

# Build instructions
You need SFML to be installed on your system in order to build this project. Then you can use CMake to generate the project and build it.
This is an OOP project, so that "src" cotains .cpp files only and "iclude" contains all the .h files
The "Attributes" folder contains textures, fonts and music needed by the executable.
